── .✦.⋆♱ The Pinewood Orphanage were no longer safe. An unknown evil-being is lurking within the house, mimicking to be one of the children. One by one, innocent souls were taken. Alas, the adult is turning a blind eye for God knows what reason. Therefore, The children (players) have to take matters into their own hands and eliminate the Mimic, fast.

࣪ ִֶָ☾. A picture of Mother Rosary praying. - 1/6/1990 { taken by The Investigator }

" she became so quiet. Or should i say, unbothered? She's always praying day and night. We weren't sure if it was upon grieve or something else. "

 5/6/1990- " we're lost. Every other night, even more children went missing. And i can't get a hold of anything! if it weren't Mother Rosary herself, could it be one of us? " ✎﹏﹏﹏﹏

 6/6/1990- " We've discovered a dead body, rotting within the bushes. She seemed to be one of us, but she was so mangled up we couldn't identify her.." ✎﹏﹏﹏﹏

8/6/1990- " We've decided to eliminate every possible suspect. We couldn't risk another death. **I** can't let that happen." ✎﹏﹏﹏﹏
